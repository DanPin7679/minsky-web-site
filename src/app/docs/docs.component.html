      Minsky is an Open-Source system-dynamics program. Open-Source means that
      its code is readily available, and that it is free. To use it, download it
      from https://sourceforge.net/projects/minsky/, and install it on your
      computer.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      System-dynamics means that it can model two or more factors which cause
      changes in each other over time. A simple model of population growth with
      just one species—Fish, for example—is not a system. It generates the
      familiar exponential curve of fish numbers growing forever—see Figure 1.
    </p>

    <p>
      Nor is a model of population decay with just one species—say, Sharks with
      no Fish to eat—a system. It generates the opposite effect of exponential
      decay—see Figure 2 (presumably, the sharks are eating each other as their
      numbers fall).
    </p>

    <p class="my-2">
      But a model with both Fish and Sharks is a system, and it has a surprising
      outcome: it never settles down to an equilibrium. Instead, as Figure 3
      illustrates, the number of fish and sharks rise and fall in cycles that go
      on forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      The capacity that system dynamics programs have to model feedback effects
      between variables frees the modeler from the tyranny of “ceteris
      paribus”—the bedrock assumption of a conventional first-year course in
      economics that “all other things remain equal”.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      With a system dynamics program, you no longer have to make that manifestly
      assumption, and a much richer and more informative model of the world
      emerges—for instance, the “predator-prey” model indicates that not all
      years are the same when you take the risk of sharing the ocean with
      sharks. System dynamics programs were first invented in the 1950s by the
      brilliant MIT Professor of Management Jay Forrester.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      There are many different programs today—Stella, Vensim, Simulink, System
      Modeler, to mention but a few. Minsky’s unique feature in this crowded
      marketplace is its capacity to model financial dynamics: systems involving
      the exchange, creation and destruction of money.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Minsky does this using what we call Godley Tables.1 System dynamics
      programs were arguably the first-ever computer programs to employ a GUI
      (“Graphical User Interface”). Godley Tables employ a GUI that long
      predates computers: the accountant’s device of “Double-entry Bookkeeping”.
      Double-entry Bookkeeping (DEB for short) was invented so that merchants
      could be sure that their financial transactions were accurately recorded.
    </p>
    <div>
      <p class="my-2">
        Though it takes a degree in accounting (or at least a course in
        bookkeeping) to fully understand it, DEB boils down to two simple
        principles:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal ml-12">
        <li>
          All financial claims are classified as either Assets or Liabilities;
        </li>
        <li>All financial transactions are recorded twice.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p class="my-2">
      Assets are financial claims on another person or entity; Liabilities are a
      financial claim that another person or entity has on you. For any person
      or entity (a business, charity, etc.), the gap between its Assets and its
      Liabilities is its net worth, which is called its Equity.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      The recording of all transactions twice enables a check on the accuracy of
      an accountant’s books via the formula that: • 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑒𝑒𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 −
      𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿𝑒𝑒𝐴𝐴 = 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝐸𝐸, or • 𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴𝑒𝑒𝐴𝐴𝐴𝐴 −
      𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝐿𝐿𝑒𝑒𝐴𝐴 − 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐿𝐿𝐴𝐴𝐸𝐸 = 0 In accounting, if a given
      transaction is properly recorded, then this equation will hold. If there’s
      a mistake, this equation is violated.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      This simple set of rules enables accountants to show the state of a
      business. Minsky uses this “fundamental accounting equation” to enable you
      to build a model of financial dynamics easily and rapidly, without the
      messy wiring of the standard system dynamics “flowchart” paradigm.
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Instead, we use Godley Tables, where all claims are recorded as either
      Assets (A) or Liabilities (L), the Equity (E) of each entity in a model is
      tracked, and any error is checked by the simple rule 𝐴𝐴 − 𝐿𝐿 − 𝐸𝐸 = 0.
      Figure 4 show a blank Godley Table.
    </p>

    <p class="my-2">
      This simple GUI makes it easy to answer questions that are still
      contentious in economics and finance today: • Do banks lend out deposits,
      or do they create money “from nothing”? • Do banks lend out reserves, or
      do loans create deposits with no need for reserves?
    </p>
    <p class="my-2">
      Economics textbooks argue that banks need deposits in order to be able
      lend, and that reserves— the cash that banks have in their vaults, plus
      the funds that private banks have in their own deposit accounts at the
      Central Bank—play an essential role in lending and money creation. In
      2014, the Bank of England said that the textbooks were wrong: “The reality
      of how money is created today differs from the description found in some
      economics textbooks: • Rather than banks receiving deposits when
      households save and then lending them out, bank lending creates deposits.
      • In normal times, the central bank does not fix the amount of money in
      circulation, nor is central bank money ‘multiplied up’ into more loans and
      deposits.” McLeay, 2014 #5066, p. 41
